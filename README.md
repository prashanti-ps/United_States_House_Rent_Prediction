**UNITED STATES HOUSE RENT PREDICTION**



**Introduction**:

1.**Background**:
	The main goal of the research is to create a prediction model using Machine Learning to predict the rental costs of houses across the United States based on numerous variables defining the houses' attributes. This dataset contains several features that characterize the entire nature of the house and its dynamics, as well as ‘Price’ which is to be predicted.
	
2.**Motivation**:
	While renting a house we consider different factors such as location, size, number of rooms, etc. that play an important role in making the decision to rent it. This decision can sometimes be difficult to make with the rising number of options. This project will help both the landlords to set an acceptable rent on their properties and the tenants to rent the property on the right price. This prediction technique will also assist investors in making informed investment selections to optimize their profits. 
	
3.**Goal**:
	We want to build a model that can inform people what a fair rent for a specific listing (home) in a specific location with amenities would cost at any given time. Using various types of models, we want to reduce the disparity between the real rent and the rent anticipated. Various sorts of machine learning techniques will be used to assess the performance of our model.
	

**Methodology**:

We will analyze the dataset to identify different aspects. To start with, we will perform EDA to get the overall idea of the dataset. We will then perform data cleaning by identifying the missing values, numerical variables, and their distribution. We will use Seaborn library to visualize the data to identify outliers, categorical variables, etc. We will then use Pair plot to get 2D plotting of all the features and then analyze the result which will help in choosing the right machine learning model. The potential algorithms which we can use for our data are:
•	Linear Regression

•	K-Nearest Neighbors

•	Decision Tree

•	Random Forest

•	Gradient Boosting


**Description**:

The dataset for housing prices is 380.29 MB in size and has 22 columns with 265192 records. It contains the unique id of every house along with its details like region, type, number of rooms, amenities, pet allowances, description, location, and most important attribute ‘price’.
